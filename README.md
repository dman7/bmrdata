## Section 8 
### Introduction
Housing 8 vouchers authorizes the payment of rental housing assistance to private landlords. There are two types of programs:
1. Housing Choice Voucher Program (tenant-based) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_8_(housing) ]
     * A tenant can move from one unit to another.
     * Tenant can reject people with Section 8.
     * Maximum allowed voucher is $2200/mo.
2. Project Based Rental Assistance Program (project-based)
     * Property owner reserves some/all of units in a building for low-income tenants.
     * If you leave, you lose the Section 8 voucher.

### Process of getting Housing 8
* The Housing 8 list must be open.

* Your acceptance/rejection is subjective, partially based on how much you make.
* After that, you wait a few years and get your Housing 8 voucher.

* Section 8 has its own set of regulations [http://www.sfha.org/SFA_HCV_Payment_Standard_2011.pdf]
* Standard #1: property must be less than the fair market price
* Standard #2: You must meet income limits.


## Affordable Housing
In this section, we discuss how Section 8 voucher holders go about searching for properties. Technically, a voucher holder can go to *any* property and try to live there, but it is likely that he/she will be rejected. Their best bet are Below Market Rate (BMR) units. A BMR property is defined as:
     * a property that must stay affordable for 55 years, and
     * a property must accept Section 8 housing
In San Francisco, some developments must have 10 - 20% of units be BMR units.


### Property-specific (BMR) Regulations
* Each property has its own set of regulations on top of Section 8 regulations. 
* Here is an example: http://www.sf-moh.org/index.aspx?page=1110


 ## Other vouchers
The vouchers besides Section 8 are Certificate of Preference, which allows people, who were screwed over 40 years ago, to skip the BMR line and get preference for units.
